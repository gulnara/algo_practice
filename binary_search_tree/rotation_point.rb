# Write a method for finding the index of the "rotation point," which is where I started working from the beginning of the dictionary. This array is huge (there are lots of words I don't know) so we want to be efficient here.

words = [
  'ptolemaic',
  'retrograde',
  'supplant',
  'undulate',
  'xenoepist',
  'asymptote',  # <-- rotates here!
  'babka',
  'banoffee',
  'engender',
  'karpatka',
  'othellolagkage',
