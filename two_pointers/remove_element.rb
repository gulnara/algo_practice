# This problem is quite similar to our parent problem. We can follow a two-pointer approach and shift numbers left upon encountering the ‘key’. Here is what the code will look like

def remove_element(arr, key)

end

puts remove_element([3, 2, 3, 6, 3, 10, 9, 3], 3) == 4
puts remove_element([2, 11, 2, 2, 1], 2) == 2
